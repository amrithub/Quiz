| 1  | 16/11/2019 1:27pm | In the beginning, I had planned to take the input regarding the quiz questions  from an array inside the index.rb file. But, it didn't look much efficient way as it would make the code unnecessarily long as the whole data containing the  questions had to be included in the index.rb file. so, after the consultation  with our head instructer Bianca, I modified my code so that it can load data  from a different file named qb.txt. As a result, I can pass the question bank from .txt file to ruby file and the rest of the program will run in the initial  manner except the way of passing the data. This obviously made the code more effective and memory efficient. |   |   |

For this objective, every question were to be compared to the one selected randomly  and I had used as many if condition as the number of questions. this obviously was  an inefficient way because it would make the code unnecessarily lengthy and would  reduce the speed of program execution. This made the code capable of dealing with large number of questions at once without scanning each of them.                   |   |   |
