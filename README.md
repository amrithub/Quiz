# **Introduction**
This is a quiz application where a user can participate in a test of multiple choice question answers. User can choose between practice mode and tournament mode. At the end of program execution, the user gets his/her score as well as correct answers. In case of tournament mode, the user can compare his/her score with four previous players in a tabulated format.

| User Input          | 1. Determine the data structure of input  2. Determine the range of user input  3. apply conditional statements  4. Apply for loop and while loop  5. Apply a method for a more effective design  6. Test the inputs with different users who    know nothing about my project.                                            | High     | 18/11/2019 |
| Multimode           | 1. Determine number of modes.  2. Use if statement to switch to different modes.  3. Use different loops.  4. Use methods as required.  5. Test the modes with different users.                                                                                                                                            | low      | 19/11/2019 |
| Perpetual operation | 1. Determine if perpetual operation is desirable or not.  2. Determine where to restart the execution.  3. Use if statement for to continually run the program.  4. Use a method to call the game as long as the user  wants.  5. Test for this feature with different people who are    not familiar to your application. | mdium    | 19/11/2019 |
