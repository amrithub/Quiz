# **Introduction**
This is a quiz application where a user can participate in a test of multiple choice question answers. User can choose between practice mode and tournament mode. At the end of program execution, the user gets his/her score as well as correct answers. In case of tournament mode, the user can compare his/her score with four previous players in a tabulated format.

| User Input             | * Deterrmine the data structure of input<br>* Determine the range of user input<br>* apply conditional statements<br>* Apply for loop and while loop<br>* Apply a method for a more effective design<br>* Test the inputs with different users who <br>  know nothing about my project.                                                | High     | 18/11/2019 |
| Multimode              | * Determine number of modes.<br>* Use if statement to switch to different modes.<br>* Use different loops.<br>* Use methods as required.<br>* Test the modes with different users.<br>                                                                                                                                                 | low      | 19/11/2019 |
| Perpetual<br>operation | * Determine if perpetual operation is desirable<br>or not.<br>* Determine where to restart the execution.<br>* Use if statement for to continually run the program.<br>* Use a method to call the game as long as the user <br>wants.<br>* Test for this feature with different people who are <br>  not familiar to your application. | mdium    | 19/11/2019 |
